<h1>CS-465 Full Stack Development With MEAN</h1>
<p>The intention of this project was to take a static HTML webpage, and convert it to a full stack page with a backend SPA page to allow an administrator to login and make changes to the user viewing page.</p>

<h2>Architecture</h2>
<h3><em>Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application.</em></h3>
<p>The original structure that was used for this website was a static HTML setup which was changed over to a handebars (.hbs) structure, allowing the page to load quicker than static since it does not need to load the entire page all at once for user view. Since the original page was a static HTML structure, it could not communicate with backend database and therefore could not update information in a way that is simple and makes sense to any administrator. The single page application site that was created is to allow administrators to login with their own credentials, and make any changes to the database, or even delete and add options to the database.</p>

<h3><em>Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?</em></h3>
<p>NoSQL MongoDB database was the sinmplest structure for this database. Though there are other powerful relational databases out there, NoSQL database can still store relationship data in a way that doesn't need to be split between tables that a traditional database uses.</p>

<h2>Functionality</h2>
<h3><em>How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?</em></h3>
<p>Javascript is a scripting language of which brings normal boring HTML/CSS pages to action. Where HTML is the coffee and CSS is the milk, Javascript is the addition that breathes energy and brings one to life. JSON is short for JavaScript Object Notation and its responsibility is to connect the dots when transferring data. JSON is what helps connect the backend to the frontend and allows administrators to make the changes that the users will see and interact with.</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>
<h3><em>Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.</em></h3>
<p>Methods provide extended functionality for a webpage using GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. This is what makes the website standout as a full stack website rather than a static HTML page. These methods allow for not only updating information on the website, but also gives an adminstrator privelages to make these changes and only by an adminstrator.</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<h3><em>How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals?</em></h3>
<p>Professionally, my goal is to be as well rounded as possible. Understanding how to build a website is a great skill, but taking the website and turning it in to a fully functioning page that allows for customer data and administrator privelages is not only something that any company would want, it is what every company should have when it comes to their customer facing websites. This has helped me understand the ins and outs of connecting hte dots from the backend to the frontend and how to build upon these new privelages.</p>

<h3><em>What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?</em></h3>
<p>I have learned how to properly reverse engineer a static HTML page, and rebuild it into a full stack fully functioning website with a single-page-application (SPA) website to allow for administrators to make appropriate changes. I also learned how to create the database of which will allow the administrators to have their own logins and restraints with what they can and can not do with the page. Lastly I have gain an understanding of how diffrerent methods and components of the code interact between the frontend and backend parts of the website.</p>
